							<img src="image/bibimbap2.jpg" >
						</div>
						<p style="color: black;">
						Bibimbap means in Korean mixed rice, all the ingredients are put separately in a stone bowl called Dolsot...
						It may seem like a small detail, but when you taste it, it changes everything because the bowl, which is heated before being garnished, keeps the ingredients warm and enhances the taste experience. Generally speaking, Korean cuisine is a tasty and elegant cuisine that celebrates diversity, color and balance. Based on rice for energy, fiber (vegetables in equal quantities, such as zucchini, carrots, mushrooms) for vitamins and minerals, an egg or meat for protein, chili or kimchi (pickled cabbage) for taste, you can also add seaweed rich in antioxidants! And to play with flavors and aromas, you can play with a variety of seasonings such as garlic, spring onion, sesame oil or chili paste.

						<h2><b>Macaroons</b></h2>
						<div class="entry-thumbnail">						
							<img src="image/macaron.jpeg" >
						</div>
						<p style="color: blueviolet;">
							Macaroons were created in Arab countries. They were presented in the form of a cookie in the past. The original recipe of macaroons is composed of almond powder, sugar and egg whites. 
							They appeared in France during the renaissance at the time of the marriage of Catherine de Medicis with the Duke of Orleans. 
							After their appearance in France its original recipe was revisited but it is only in 1830 in Paris that the Parisian pastry cooks decided to assemble them two by two by filling them with a small jam called "ganache".
							Then, the LadurÃ©e store, one of the most famous, popularized it by naming it "Le Macaron Parisien".
							There is a legend around the round shape. The story of the macaroon tells that a monk used to knead almond paste with his shirt off. One day, very tired, he fell from exhaustion and left a trace of his navel on the dough.
							At that moment, the macaroon took the shape of a round.
							A very original legend whose veracity has never been proven.
							The raspberry macaroon is for me the ultimate macaroon! You don't like raspberries? No worries, the macaroon is a delicacy that can be declined to all tastes...
							One thing I am sure of is that I am never disappointed when I enjoy a raspberry or salted butter caramel macaron. 
							Would you like to try some? A value on "Pierre HermÃ©

						<p style="color:orange;">
							Vietnamese pho, pronounced almost like the "fire" of "pot-au-feu", is probably the most popular and world-famous dish of Vietnamese gastronomy. 
							I really like that dish because it's heartwarming. I enjoy it especially in winter. It warmed your body, put you in a relaxed mood. 
							even if you are having a bad day, a bowl of PhÃ´ is enough to make you feel better.

						<p style="color:green">
							Emblematic dish of Peru it comes in several forms Fresh, refreshing, tangy, ceviche is the first dish I've ever had with raw fish*( not really*). 
							Why not really? This dish is composed of raw fish and various other ingredients but the second main ingredient is lemon (yellow, or green). 
							 The acid in the lemon juice chemically denatures the proteins in your fish, in the same way that proteins are denatured when heated. 
							It's a very fine dish that should be appreciated when the good weather comes back.

							In french "Placali sauce gombo"
							Huummm... i don't have words. This dish, this dish it orgasmic, for real with a teaspoon of pepper paste ðŸ¤¤ðŸ¤¤ðŸ¤¤. 
							Cassava came from the tuber family, it's a kind of potato but very different.
							<p style="color: blue;"> Okra is an African veggie, it's one of the richest foods in vitamin C, it contains minerals and is an ally for the health of all. 
							Cassava Yam is made with fermented cassava paste (it's better to make it at the end when you okra soup is ready to have a warm yam).
							Okra soup is not complicate to make, you just need to cut your okra slicely or mixed it a little (better to cut it). </p>
							<p style="color: blue;"> You can make your okra soup with what you want (meat, shrimp, fish,crabs, smoked beef skin...), don't forget the pepper and palm oil to give to your okra soup a good flavor.
							When your dish is ready, serve the cassava yam first, then you can add your okra soup on it , cover it and everything you want crabs,smoked beef skin, shrimp, pepper( my favorite comboðŸ˜‹ðŸ¤¤ðŸ¤¤)
							Get a beer out of the fridge and open it, wash your hands(you don't need fork, spoon, or knife), take a sit, don't forget to pray and don't forget to pray and now enjoy your meal.</p>
